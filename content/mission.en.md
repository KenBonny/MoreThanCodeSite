# My mission

The mission of More Than Code, my mission, is to improve the quality of software. When the quality of a codebase improves, the quality of the product improves as well. Features can be implemented more easily and with less bugs as a result. I want to achieve this mission by adhering to my values. Values I think are shared by many other developers in the community. I do think that values can be upheld through various methods, so I will outline how I give substance to my values.

### I am honest and reliable


### I write high quality software
All developers want to create high quality software. I am convinced that the road to this end result is paved with a huge number of automated tests. To ensure that the software is properly delivered, a continous delivery mechanism needs to be set up. 

Unfortunately, I do make mistakes (occasionally). That is why I try to continuously improve not only the code I work on, but myself as well. I apply a lot of refactorings throughout the code that I write to make it more clean and readable. I also apply a lot of refactorings to myself by reading blog posts, attend training and by listening to the feedback I receive.

### I have a positive attitude
