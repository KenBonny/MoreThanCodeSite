# Contact
{{< alert >}}
I do have to warn you, I dislike being disturbed by phonecalls.<br />
A phonecall is very invasive. Most of the time, I'm called at an inconvenient moment. I prefer a non urgent way of contact.

{{% card title="Immediately" %}}
If you do need to get in touch urgently, your best option is to call me on [+32 (0)497 99 81 62](tel:+32497998162).

If I can't pick up, I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

Because it's not always possible to meet face-to-face, I am available via video calls. The easiest way to reach me is to call to [my Skype account](https://join.skype.com/invite/lY78H29xjQ3a).

I also have a [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/6549781686) account.

Should you have another platform in mind, I can accomodate you.

Making an appointment beforehand is advisable, as I don't have these applications open by default.

If you want to sponsor me for no reason at all (or I need easy access to my bank account number), it's here:

My [blog](https://kenbonny.net/) is where I write about the technical challenges I encounter and how I solve them. I hope some other developers find it helpful. I occasionally write about my personal life or something that has happened to me.

My blog is a good place to gauge my technical skill, but nothing beats the actual code that I produce. This can be found on [my GitHub profile {{< icon b github >}}](https://github.com/KenBonny). Here you can find out if my code is as clean as I say it is.

No profile is complete without a good, oldfashioned [resume {{< icon s file-pdf >}}](documents/cv-ken-bonny-en.pdf)

Finally, if you need to encrypt a message that you want to send to me and don't trust Wire or Signal, you can find [my KeyBase profile {{< icon b keybase >}}](https://keybase.io/kenbonny). If you don't know what that is, don't worry about it, it's a technical, security and mainly geek thing.
