# Welcome
I am Ken Bonny, a software craftsman specialising in Microsoft technology. 

As founder of More Than Code, I help my partners to accomplish their goals 
by architecting and developing clean, secure and easy to maintain software.

## Contact
{{< alert >}}
I do have to warn you, I dislike being disturbed by phonecalls.<br />
A phonecall is very invasive. Most of the time, I'm called at an inconvenient moment. I prefer a non urgent way of contact.

### Miscelaneous
I [blog](https://kenbonny.net/) about technical subjects, but I occasionally write about my personal life or something that has happened to me. This is also a great place to gauge my technical skill.

Speaking about technical skill, you can check out most of my personal projects on my [{{< icon b github >}} GitHub profile](https://github.com/KenBonny). This allows you to see for yourself how clean my code is.

KeyBase is a platform to manage public encryption keys. If you don't know what that is, don't worry about it, it's a technical, security and mainly geek thing. If you do know what it is and for some reason need to encrypt your message to me, you can find my public key in [{{< icon b keybase >}} my KeyBase profile](https://keybase.io/kenbonny).

Finally, no profile is complete without a good, oldfashioned [{{< icon s file-pdf >}} resume](documents/cv-ken-bonny.pdf).
