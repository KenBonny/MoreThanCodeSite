# Available services

### Consultancy
As an experienced developer, I can advise you about the future of your software and which direction to steer it to stay relevant. I can guide your team towards that goal by implementing _best practices_, automated testing and to set up continous integration so these improvements make it to production.

### Moving to the cloud
When _lift and shift_ falls short, it can be advantageous to look into more sustainable and cost efficient ways to utilise the cloud. With my expertise, I can help you plan and execute your move.

### Development
This brings my skills into your development team as I will be working side by side with then to improve the system.

### Training and coaching
If your developers' knowlegde falls a bit short on a specific topic, I can train them in a classroom setting. Afterwards, I follow up by visiting several times over the next few weeks to answer any additional questions specific to your codebase. My most prominent knowledge is in automated testing and back-end architecture, but I can prepare specific training tailored to your needs.
