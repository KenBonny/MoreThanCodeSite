      <description>My mission The mission of More Than Code, my mission, is to improve the quality of software. When the quality of a codebase improves, the quality of the product improves as well. Features can be implemented more easily and with less bugs. I want to achieve this mission by adhering to my values. Values I think are shared by many other developers in the community.
I am reliable and punctual  I keep my promises, even if there is no contract involved.</description>
